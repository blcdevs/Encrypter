# Encrypter

Go to your browser and visit 

localhost:3000

I believe it was encryptor or so

There are 2 ways to create a database

You can click on the database on the image to do that using the GUI

Writing the query may be a bit tasking for you via chat

Oh it’s encrypter not encryptor

Then send me the content in the folder

If you’ve created the db you can change it in the notepad and save

Then change the notepad to encrypter

You can edit the DB name but so we don’t stress just change the notepad content

From the phpmyadmin but don’t bother about that

Just change the notepad name to what you used as the db name which is encrypter

Is there a file with a .sql in it

If I didn’t send that to you then you need to run the DB migrate to load the seeds into the data base

Command prompt

Shift + Ctl + right mouse button

You can press this in the directory

Or just open command prompt and go into the directory

But before that, type ls

You can run the other command

## After this, run this command npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
## After running this command, run this npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all

Then you can run npm start to run the app.
